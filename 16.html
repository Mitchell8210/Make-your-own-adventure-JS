    <p>you speed up and take the turn just in time to miss flying to an early grave</p>
    <p>you push your car to the limit and hear it whining and feel it nearly shaking apart</p>
    <p>you see a place to stop where you might get the advantage over the mystery man that has been following you.</p>
    <p>you stop and wait as the mans car comes around the corner... this is it. you have the chance to knock him off the road and end this chase once and for all... what do you want to do? 'shoot his tires out' or 'wave him down' </p>
