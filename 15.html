    <p>you slow down cautiously to see if you can recognize the car that is following you but then you hear gunshots ring out.</p>
    <p>you frantically swerve from side to side trying to avoid an early grave, until a turn that you failed to notice catches you off guard and sends your car flying into a ditch on the side of the road.</p>
    <p>as your car is tumbling through the air your whole life flashes through your eyes and you realize just how scared of death that you are. but its too late...</p>
    <p>you slam into the ditch and your car immediately bursts into flames. you feel the intense heat from the flames, and feel your skin being burned beyond repair as you fight to get out of the car.</p>
    <p>you are nearly out when things start to go dark and you black out from the pain.</p>
