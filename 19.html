    <p>you fire off an entire mag into his car and successfully shoot two of his tires out and he loses control of the car.</p>
    <p>unfortunately, his car ends up coming right for you and rams into you with the force of 1000 horses.</p>
    <p>you wake up in a prison hospital in siberia and find out that the United States government has disowned you and denied any knowledge of your involvement within the CIA.</p>
    <p>it is now up to you to escape your captors, return to America and kill everyone that did you wrong.</p>
    <p>Well done. You made it the furthest in the game. Congratulations.......</p>
